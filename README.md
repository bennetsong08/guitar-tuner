This is a basic guitar tuner made in C using Kiss-FFT, SDL, and GTK. GTK4 must be installed for this project. Kiss-FFT and SDL2 are included in the "include" folder.

This project was made for the 2022-23 IB MYP Personal Project program. 

Due to limited time constraints, the program is buggy and very barebones, and functionality is not guaranteed.  All code was written in one file (main.c) for simplicity and time reasons.
